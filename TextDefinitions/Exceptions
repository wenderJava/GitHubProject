Exceptions alter the program flow.


JAVA LANG OBJECT --> JAVA LANG THROWABLE --> JAVA LANG EXCEPTION --> JAVA LANG RUNTIME EXCEPTION
                                         --> JAVA LANG ERROR
                                         
ERROR = something went wrong and the program should not recover from this   

RUNTIME EXCEPTION = also known as unexpected exceptions.
