Start with CLRS book. Try to solve classical DP problems such as EDIT DISTANCE or LONGEST SUBSEQUENCE. And by solve, I mean, take some sample input, code in a solution in a language you know, run some test cases.

I won't go into all that mouthful theories of sub-optimal structures.

Now, go to http://www.geeksforgeeks.org and check out how they solved the dynamic programming problems. They have a good collection of standard dynamic programming problems. Don't look at solutions at first. Try coding them on your own. Yeah, everyone says that! But you are sincere about learning, and the secret cheat code is, if you honestly attempt without looking at the solution at first, it would benefit you a lot. Then check the comments too, for alternate solution for the same problem.

Next, try out TopCoder tutorials. Try solving similar DP problems from Sphere Online Judge (SPOJ), Programming Competition,Programming Contest,Online Computer Programming , HackerRank etc. competitive coding sites. Scourge Google for DP questions in interviews.
